# PRD: Document Data Extraction with Multi-Strategy Testing

## Objective
Build an application that extracts data from documents by testing 20 different AI prompt strategies and identifying the most effective approach.

## Problem Statement
Different prompt strategies yield varying accuracy for document data extraction. Manual testing of strategies is time-consuming and inconsistent. Need automated way to test and validate multiple approaches.

## Success Criteria
- Successfully test 20+ different extraction strategies on same document
- Provide quantifiable comparison metrics (accuracy, speed, cost)
- Identify best-performing strategy for given document type
- Support multiple document formats (PDF, images, text)

## Core Features

### 1. Strategy Management
- Define 20+ extraction prompt templates
- Each strategy has unique approach (structured, conversational, step-by-step, etc.)
- Easy to add/modify strategies
- Strategy versioning

### 2. Document Processing
- Support PDF, images, plain text
- OCR capability for scanned documents
- Handle multi-page documents
- Preprocessing (cleanup, formatting)

### 3. Extraction Engine
- Execute all strategies on same document
- Parallel execution where possible
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Cost tracking per strategy

### 4. Validation & Comparison
- Define ground truth or reference data
- Compare strategy outputs against ground truth
- Metrics: accuracy score, extraction completeness, consistency
- Handle partial matches and fuzzy comparison

### 5. Results & Analytics
- Side-by-side comparison of all strategies
- Performance ranking
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Export results to CSV/JSON
- Visualization of metrics

## Technical Constraints
- API rate limits consideration
- Cost optimization (especially for 20x calls)
- Processing time for large documents
- Memory efficiency for batch processing

## Future Enhancements
- Machine learning to auto-generate new strategies
- Document type detection and strategy recommendation
- Multi-language support
- Real-time strategy optimization
