# Why Not Cloudflare? And What to Use Instead

## The Problem with Cloudflare

**Cloudflare Workers doesn't fully support Python web frameworks like FastAPI.**

- Python Workers is experimental and limited
- No support for FastAPI, Flask, Django
- Can't handle file uploads properly
- Limited to simple serverless functions

## ‚úÖ Best Alternatives (Better Than Cloudflare!)

## What About Cloudflare Pages?

You CAN use Cloudflare for the frontend only:

1. Deploy backend to Railway/Render
2. Get your backend URL (e.g., `https://myapp.railway.app`)
3. Update `static/app.js`:
   ```javascript
   const API_BASE = 'https://myapp.railway.app';
   ```
4. Deploy static files to Cloudflare Pages:
   ```bash
   wrangler pages deploy static --project-name=ai-prompt-tester
   ```

This gives you:
- ‚ö° Fast global CDN (Cloudflare)
- üñ•Ô∏è Powerful backend (Railway/Render)

## My Recommendation

**For You:** Use **Railway**

**Why:**
1. Push to GitHub ‚Üí Auto-deploy ‚Üí Done
2. Best developer experience
3. Easy environment variables
4. Great monitoring
5. Fast deployments
