## Tips

- **Start with Gemini** - It's free and fast
- **Use OpenRouter** - For testing multiple model types
- **Compare costs** - See which strategies are most economical
- **Check accuracy** - Some strategies are better for specific document types

## Troubleshooting

### Server won't start
```bash
# Make sure FastAPI is installed
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart

# Try running directly
uvicorn api:app --reload
```

### Can't access localhost:8000
- Check if port 8000 is already in use
- Try a different port: `uvicorn api:app --port 8080`

### API key errors
- Make sure `.env` file exists in the project root
- Verify the API key is valid
- Check you have credits/quota remaining

## Next Steps

Once you've tested locally:
1. See `README_DEPLOYMENT.md` for deployment options
2. Deploy to Railway, Render, or Fly.io for free
3. Share with users to test strategies on their documents
4. Analyze which strategies work best for your use case

## Development

To customize the frontend:
- Edit `static/index.html` for structure
- Edit `static/styles.css` for styling
- Edit `static/app.js` for functionality

The API automatically serves the updated files.

## API Endpoints

If you want to integrate with other tools:

- `GET /` - Web interface
- `GET /strategies` - List all strategies
- `POST /extract` - Extract with all strategies
- `POST /extract-single` - Extract with one strategy
- `GET /health` - Health check

Example API call:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/extract" \
  -F "file=@invoice.pdf" \
  -F "provider=gemini" \
  -F "max_concurrent=5"
```

Enjoy testing your prompting strategies! üéâ
